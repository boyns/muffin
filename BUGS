Hi, 
 
I'm trying to remove a tagattr with no value with the NoThanks-fiter in muffin. 
 
For example <frame noresize .....> 
 
My killfile looks like this: 
  tagattr frame.noresize remove 
or 
  tagattr frame.noresize remove .* 
with should be the same. 
 
But "noresize" is not removed!! 
 
The problem is in compare in org/doit/muffin/filter/NoThanks.java . 
 
Because noresize has no value pattern is null. But re.getMatch(pattern)
