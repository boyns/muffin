<h1>
How to Write a Muffin Filter</h1></center>

<p>There are many example filters provided with Muffin. You can also
check the mailing list <a href="http://www.geocrawler.com/redir-sf.php3?list=muffin-users">archives</a>
or <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/muffin-users">subscribe</a>
for more help.

<p>Muffin filters use the Model-View-Controller paradigm.
"Model" means data, "view" means user interface, and "controller" means
main logic. So most filters are made up of 3 classes, one for your data, one
for the user interface, and one for your filter logic. For example,
the Cache filter is implemented by the 3 classes Cache, CacheFrame,
and CacheFilter.
The Cache class manages the data, CacheFrame is the ui, and CacheFilter has the
controlling logic.

<p>It's easiest if you put your filter classes in the org.doit.muffin.filter package.
Muffin expects you to give your data class the same name as your filter,
and then use that name as a prefix for the names of your user interface and
filter logic classes. Add "Frame" to create your ui class name and "Filter"
for the name of your logic class, just like Cache, CacheFrame and CacheFilter.

<p>Include a help text file for your filter in
the doc/filters directory. The Cache filter help file is Cache.txt.

<p>Your data class must implement the
<a href="javadoc/org/doit/muffin/FilterFactory.html">FilterFactory</a>
interface. Simple persistent data is stored in a shared instance of 
<a href="javadoc/org/doit/muffin/Prefs.html">Prefs</a>.
Muffin passes the Prefs instance into your data class by calling
your <b>setPrefs</b> method.
If you need more storage, you can also keep data in files, databases, etc.

<p>Your user interface class implements
<a href="javadoc/org/doit/muffin/MuffinFrame.html">MuffinFrame</a>.
Notice that user interface frames have a similar look, with fairly standardized
buttons at the bottom. Muffin uses AWT for its GUI, so you'll
probably need to implement AWT's ActionListener and WindowListener interfaces.
For reliability and portability, it's a good idea to limit your
AWT component layouts to just BorderLayout and GridBagLayout.

<p>The interfaces you'll implement in your filter logic class depend on
what kind of filtering you want to do. To filter requests before they go
out to a server implement <a href="javadoc/org/doit/muffin/RequestFilter.html">RequestFilter</a>.
If you want to respond to some or all requests without sending the request
to a server at all, you need <a href="javadoc/org/doit/muffin/HttpFilter.html">HttpFilter</a>
and its superinterface, <a href="javadoc/org/doit/muffin/HttpRelay.html">HttpRelay</a>.
If you want to see or modify replies after a server responds, implement
<a href="javadoc/org/doit/muffin/ReplyFilter.html">ReplyFilter</a>.

<p>To modify the content of an HTTP server's response, as opposed to the header
and status info, use <a href="javadoc/org/doit/muffin/ContentFilter.html">ContentFilter</a>.
The <a href="javadoc/org/doit/io/InputObjectStream.html">InputObjectStream</a> and
<a href="javadoc/org/doit/io/OutputObjectStream.html">OutputObjectStream</a>
are streams of Java objects which represent the content.
A Java object is just an instance of a class.
The InputObjectStream will be either an
<a href="javadoc/org/doit/io/HtmlObjectStream.html">HtmlObjectStream</a> or a plain
<a href="javadoc/org/doit/io/SourceObjectStream.html">SourceObjectStream</a>.
An HtmlObjectStream consists of HTML
<a href="javadoc/org/doit/html/Token.html">Token</a> objects.
Content which isn't an HTML MIME type is returned as a SourceObjectStream,
which provides the content as
<a href="javadoc/org/doit/io/ByteArray.html">ByteArray</a> objects.
Because each content is filtered in its own thread,
you must also implement <b>Runable</b> and do all your filtering in the <b>run</b>
method. Muffin will call <b>run</b> once for each content filtered.

<p>When your filter classes compile and you're ready to test, start Muffin.
It's a good idea to start it from a shell since errors and many debugging
messages are sent to System.out. Under the <b>Edit</b> menu select "<b>Filters...</b>".
In the <b>Filters</b> dialog click on the "<b>New..."</b> button. Type
in the name of your filter, for example "Cache".
When the new filter appears in the "<b>Supported Filters</b>" list of the
<b>Filters</b>
dialog, select your filter and click the <b>Enable</b> button. Your filter
is now running. Check the shell window for any errors. To test your user
interface class, select your new filter in the "<b>Enabled Filters</b>"
list and click the "<b>Preferences...</b>" button.

<p>
When your new filter is working, be sure to let the
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/muffin-users">
mailing list</a> know.
