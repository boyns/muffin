Secretar can automtically fill-in HTML forms.  Secretary is configured
using a formfile which is typically located in the Muffin preferences
directory.  This formfile contains a list of name-value pairs commonly
found in HTML forms.

Form input fields with know names will be assigned default values from
the formfile.  For example, assume the following is included in the
formfile:

    email=boyns@sdsu.edu

When Secretary finds a form input field similar to:

    Enter your E-Mail address: &lt;input type=text name=email size=20&gt;

Secretary will insert a default value:

    Enter your E-Mail address: &lt;input type=text name=email size=20 value="boyns@sdsu.edu"&gt;

Example formfile:

firstname=Mark
middlename=R
middle=R
lastname=Boyns
name=Mark Boyns
contact=Mark Boyns
email=boyns@sdsu.edu
city=San Diego
state=CA
country=USA
url=http://www.sdsu.edu/~boyns/
