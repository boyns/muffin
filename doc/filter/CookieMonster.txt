What is a Cookie?  The best answer to this question can be found in
the WWW Security FAQ by Lincoln D. Stein located at:

    http://www.w3.org/Security/Faq/

There are serious privacy issues regarding cookies that are very well
covered in the above FAQ.  Basically it is possible for web sites to
build user profiles based on the web sites a particular user has
visited.  This is commonly referred to as "user tracking".

Concerned?  If so, use the CookieMonster.

The CookieMonster monitors all HTTP requests and replies for HTTP
cookies.  When found, the CookieMonster monster can be configured to
eat cookies in requests, replies, or both.  "Eat" in this case means
that the corresponding HTTP header will be removed before being sent
to the browser or server.  Servers send cookies using the Set-Cookie
header while browsers use Cookie.

This filter has the following configurable preferences:

* CookieMonster.eatReplyCookies

  Eat cookies sent by the server.  This will remove all Set-Cookie
  headers.

* CookieMonster.eatRequestCookies

  Eat cookies sent by the browser.  This will remove all Cookie
  headers.
