What is a Cookie?  The best answer to this question can be found in
the WWW Security FAQ by Lincoln D. Stein located at:

    http://www.w3.org/Security/Faq/

There are serious privacy issues regarding cookies that are very well
covered in the above FAQ.  Basically it is possible for web sites to
build user profiles based on the web sites a particular user has
visited.  This is commonly referred to as "user tracking".

Concerned?  If so, use the CookieMonster.

The CookieMonster monitors all HTTP requests and replies for HTTP
cookies.  When found, the CookieMonster monster can be configured to
filter cookies in requests, replies, or both.  Servers send cookies
using the Set-Cookie header while browsers use Cookie.

This filter has the following configurable preferences:

* CookieMonster.filterReplyCookies

  Enables filtering of reply cookies in headers. Actual behaviour
  depends on CookieMonster.allowSessionCookies and
  CookieMonster.expirePersistentCookiesInMinutes preferences.

* CookieMonster.filterRequestCookies

  Enables filtering of request cookies in headers.  This will remove
  all Cookie headers from browser requests.

* CookieMonster.allowSessionCookies

  If enabled session cookies (cookies which are not going to be stored
  on your hard disk) will be allowed in server responses.

* CookieMonster.expirePersistentCookiesInMinutes

  Peristent cookie expire time will be limited to the number of
  minutes specified i.e. '30' will change all expire times to 30
  minutes in the future.  '0' means remove cookies completely from
  server response headers.
