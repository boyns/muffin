SelectToRadio replaces <SELECT> (combobox) by another GUI component that
displays all available choices at once.
Often comboboxes are much clumsier to operate than radio buttons where all
options are visible at once.


This filter has the following configurable preferences:

* SelectToRadio.horizontal

  Indicates whether the radio buttons should be oriented vertically. Default is
  false, i.e. the radio buttons are oriented vertically.
