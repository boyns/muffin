SelectToRadio replaces <SELECT> (combobox) by <INPUT TYPE="RADIO"> (radio button).
Often comboboxes are much clumsier to operate than radio buttons where all
options are visible at once.


This filter has the following configurable preferences:

* SelectToRadio.vertical

  Indicates whether the radio buttons should be oriented vertically. Default is
  false, i.e. the radio buttons are oriented horizontally.

  FIXME: This preference is not yet implemented!
