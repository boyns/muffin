using a glossary file which is typically located in the Muffin
preferences directory.  This glossary file contains a list of glossary
words followed by URLs.  Example glossary file:

muffin http://muffin.doit.org/
java http://java.sun.com/

Using this example file, Glossary will markup every occurance of
muffin with <a href="http://muffin.doit.org">muffin</a> and java with
<a href="http://java.sun.com/">java</a>.
