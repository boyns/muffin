PlainHtml is an html firewall with a default "deny all" rule. All executable 
tags should be filtered.

The PlainHtml filter removes comments and all html tags except the 
basics. Also filters text between style and javascript tags.

As a side effect it filters most web designer gingerbread, so pages may 
render better. No more microscopic fonts!
