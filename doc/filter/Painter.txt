Painter can remove and/or modify colors and background images found in
HTML documents.  This is done by checking the following tags and
attributes:

    Tags - body, font, table, tr, th, td

    Attributes - bgcolor, background, text, link, alink, vlink, color

Colors are specified in the form "#RRGGBB" where RR, GG, BB are red,
green, and blue hexadecimal color values.  The special color "None" is
used to remove any color for that attribute which will revert to the
browser default colors.  bgcolor has precedence over background.

This filter has the following configurable preferences:

* Painter.alink

  Accessed link color.

* Painter.background

  Background image.

* Painter.bgcolor

  Background color.

* Painter.link

  Link color.

* Painter.text

  Text color.

* Painter.vlink

  Visited link color.
