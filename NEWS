  Transfer-Encoding support.

* New HttpFilter interface.  This allows a filter to act like an
  HTTP server.  These filters can generate HTTP replies as well
  as content and can intercept any HTTP request.

  HTTP requests.  This history can be displayed with:
      http://org.doit.muffin.filter.History/

Changes since 0.5:

* New filters: HostnameExpander and ForwardedFor.

* Multiple configurations.  Rename your old "preferences" file
  to "default.conf", the name of the default configuration.

  Setup with the "autoconfig" file which contains regex and
  config name pairs.  When a match isn't found the default
  config will be used.
