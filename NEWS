Changes since 0.9.2:

* Automatically uncompress gzip encoded content so it can be filtered.
  This can be disabled with muffin.dontUncompress=true.

  specify a filename you can now also use a URL.  This can be
  used for remote NoThanks killfiles, autoconfig, *.conf files, etc.

* Disable/Enable logging from the Options window.

* Added log file rotation configured using muffin.maxLogFileSize and
  muffin.maxLogFileHistory which by default are 1MB and 10.

  Windows will use user.dir and all others will use user.home.

* Support for executable muffin.jar.

Changes since 0.9.1:

* Fix for URLs with user@host: from Kai Engert.

* Added NoThanks killfile commands: script and header.
  script can be used to perform regexp-based pattern substitution
  on javascript code.  header can be used to perform regexp-based
  pattern substitution on HTTP headers.  See NoThanks.txt for more
  details.

  in the muffin log file.

  File menu.

Changes since 0.8.1:

* New version of ImageKill filter from Heinrich Opgenoorth.

* New Translate filter from Mike Baroukh.  Translate can be
  used to implement a reverse proxy; similar to the apache
  ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse directives.

* Include dnsjava library which can be used by Muffin for
  all DNS lookups.  Nameservers are configured in the Options
  window and/or the muffin.nameservers property.

* All muffin.* preferences are now stored in ~/Muffin/muffin.props.
  muffin.* preferences found in other files will be ignored.
  Users upgrading from previous versions may want to move all
  muffin.* previous from default.conf to muffin.props to preserve
  previous settings.  Also note that the muffin.enabledFilters
  property has been renamed to FilterManager.enabledFilters.

* Support for reusable threads. 

* Added Edit menu and include Disable Filtering in File menu.

* upgraded to dnsjava-1.0.2 and gnu.regexp-1.0.8.

Changes since 0.7:

* New filter ImageKill written by Heinrich Opgenoorth.  This filter
  can block images based on their width/height ratio.

* Mac install instructions from Dave Caplinger.

* Fixed AnimationKiller bug which made netscape do bad things, like
  crash.

* Uses GNU regexp 1.0.6.

* Browser KeepAlive support is now optional.  Turning off KeepAlive
  should make Muffin appear to be faster.

* Double clicking in the Muffin progress bar display will toggle
  a normal and mini display mode -- good for saving desktop space.

* New filter NoCode written by Neil Hodgson.  This filter
  can remove Java, JavaScript, VBScript, and other languages
  such as Python and Perl.  Encoded scripts can also be removed.

* Muffin now logs all accesses in ~/Muffin/muffin.log.  This file
  uses the common log format along with some extra stuff to display
  filter results.

* New HttpFilter interface.  This allows a filter to act like an
  HTTP server.  These filters can generate HTTP replies as well
  as content and can intercept any HTTP request.

* New filter History.  Currently maintains a persistent history of all
  HTTP requests.  This history can be displayed with:
      http://org.doit.muffin.filter.History/

  Setup with the "autoconfig" file which contains regex and
  config name pairs.  When a match isn't found the default
  config will be used.
