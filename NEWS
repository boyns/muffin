Muffin NEWS - user-visible changes

Changes since 0.7:

* New filter ImageKill written by Heinrich Opgenoorth.

* Mac install instructions from Dave Caplinger.

* Bug fixes.

Changes since 0.6:

* DocumentInfo can be located top/bottom, aligned left/right, and
  has a preferences window.  Custom HTML can be include before and
  after the info.

* Remote admin (http://muffinhost:51966/) now can access all muffin
  configurations.

* Muffin can now proxy SSL (https) and connect to another SSL proxy.

* Filter help text available in filter windows and remote admin.

* Fixed HTML parsing bug which converted ALT="" to ALT.

* HTTP/1.1 persistent server connections, pipelining, and "chunked"
  Transfer-Encoding support.

* Some support for HTTP/0.9.

* Better handling of <script> tags.

* New filter EmptyFont.

* Configurable foreground and background colors.

* New HttpFilter interface.  This allows a filter to act like an
  HTTP server.  These filters can generate HTTP replies as well
  as content and can intercept any HTTP request.

* New filter History.  Currently maintains a persistent history of all
  HTTP requests.  This history can be displayed with:
      http://org.doit.muffin.filter.History/
  This filter is functional but incomplete.

* Improved (faster) regular expression support using gnu.regexp.

* Improved option parsing support using gnu.getopt.

* Referer.allowSameDomain option.

* HostnameExpander prefix and suffix options.

* New filter Rewrite which rewrites URLs using regular expressions.

Changes since 0.5:

* New filters: HostnameExpander and ForwardedFor.

* Proxy Keep-Alive support.

* View menu.

* Connections view.

* Content filters use ObjectStreams.  HTML and other content
  filtering should be much faster.

* Multiple configurations.  Rename your old "preferences" file
  to "default.conf", the name of the default configuration.

* Automatic configuration switching based on URL patterns.
  Setup with the "autoconfig" file which contains regex and
  config name pairs.  When a match isn't found the default
  config will be used.

* -conf command-line option to select a different default config.

* Configuration window for configuring configurations.  Autoconfig
  file can also be modified here.  Press the "Example" button for
  a real life autoconfig example.

* NoThanks `tagattr' command.  See doc/filters/NoThanks.txt.
