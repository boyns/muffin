Muffin NEWS - user-visible changes

Changes since 0.9.2:

* Automatically uncompress gzip encoded content so it can be filtered.
  This can be disabled with muffin.dontUncompress=true.

* Support for HTTP PUT

  specify a filename you can now also use a URL.  This can be
  used for remote NoThanks killfiles, autoconfig, *.conf files, etc.

* Disable/Enable logging from the Options window.

Changes since 0.9.1:

* Fix for URLs with user@host: from Kai Engert.

* Added NoThanks killfile commands: script and header.
  script can be used to perform regexp-based pattern substitution
  on javascript code.  header can be used to perform regexp-based
  pattern substitution on HTTP headers.  See NoThanks.txt for more
  details.

  in the muffin log file.

* Better Kaffe support.

* Fixed Decaf vs. slashdot bad html bug reported by Vladimir Klebanov.

  reg-icase to turn on and off regular expression case sensitivity.

* Added back Suspend/Resume of proxy service; now accessible via the
  File menu.

Changes since 0.8.1:

* New version of ImageKill filter from Heinrich Opgenoorth.

* New Translate filter from Mike Baroukh.  Translate can be
  used to implement a reverse proxy; similar to the apache
  ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse directives.

* Include dnsjava library which can be used by Muffin for
  all DNS lookups.  Nameservers are configured in the Options
  window and/or the muffin.nameservers property.

* All muffin.* preferences are now stored in ~/Muffin/muffin.props.
  muffin.* preferences found in other files will be ignored.
  Users upgrading from previous versions may want to move all
  muffin.* previous from default.conf to muffin.props to preserve
  previous settings.  Also note that the muffin.enabledFilters
  property has been renamed to FilterManager.enabledFilters.

* Support for reusable threads. 

* Added Edit menu and include Disable Filtering in File menu.

* upgraded to dnsjava-1.0.2 and gnu.regexp-1.0.8.

  can block images based on their width/height ratio.

* Mac install instructions from Dave Caplinger.

* Fixed AnimationKiller bug which made netscape do bad things, like
  crash.

* Uses GNU regexp 1.0.6.

  should make Muffin appear to be faster.

  a normal and mini display mode -- good for saving desktop space.

* New filter NoCode written by Neil Hodgson.  This filter
  can remove Java, JavaScript, VBScript, and other languages
  such as Python and Perl.  Encoded scripts can also be removed.

  filter results.

  HTTP server.  These filters can generate HTTP replies as well
  as content and can intercept any HTTP request.

  HTTP requests.  This history can be displayed with:
      http://org.doit.muffin.filter.History/
