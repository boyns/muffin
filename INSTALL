Muffin INSTALL - installation instructions

This file explains how to install Muffin on Unix, Win32, and MacOS.
Also included are running and browser configuration instructions.


UNIX INSTALLATION:

* `cd' to the top-level muffin directory and execute `./configure'.

* Compile muffin using `make'.  (requires GNU make)
  This will compile all the java source files and create `muffin.jar'.
  If your java compiler can't find system classes, try:

      CLASSPATH=/usr/lib/jdk1.1/lib/classes.zip make

* Type `make install' to install `muffin.jar' and `muffin'.
  By default a `muffin' shell script is installed in /usr/local/bin
  and `muffin.jar' is installed in /usr/local/lib.

* Start Muffin using the new `muffin' command.


WINDOWS INSTALLATION:

* None yet; see RUNNING below.  If you do not know how to compile Muffin
  on your system, download the latest muffin.jar from:

    http://muffin.doit.org/dist/muffin.jar


MACINTOSH INSTALLATION:

 You need Macintosh Runtime for Java (MRJ) 2.0 or better.  It comes with 
 Mac OS 8.1, or it can be had from: 

	 <http://developer.apple.com/java/text/download.html> 

 In addition, you'll need the MRJ SDK 2.01.  I got 2.01 ER4 from: 

	 <http://gemma.apple.com/java/text/prerelease.html> 

 Once you have these and the muffin.jar file, drag muffin.jar onto the 
 JBindery application.  Enter "org.doit.muffin.Main" in the class name 
 field, and check the classpath sectin to make sure that the muffin.jar
 file is in the classpath.  Save it as an application and you're done! 

 Now double-click the applet when you want to use Muffin. 

RUNNING:

There are a few different ways to run Muffin.  

* Using the shell script:

  unix$ muffin

* From within the source tree:

  unix$ cd muffin-x.x/src
  unix$ java Muffin

  win32> cd \muffin-x.x\src
  win32> \jdk1.1.4\bin\java Muffin

* Using the jar file and CLASSPATH:

  unix$ CLASSPATH=/path/muffin.jar java Muffin

* Using jre

  unix$ jre -cp /path/muffin.jar Muffin

  win32> \jdk1.1.4\bin\jre -cp \path\muffin.jar Muffin


BROWSER CONFIGURATION:

Web browsers need to be configured to use Muffin as a HTTP proxy
server.  Proxy configuration is usually found within network
preferences.  Set the HTTP proxy host to the name (or IP) of the host
Muffin is running on and set HTTP proxy port to 51966.

If your browser is already configured to use a proxy, setup the
browser to use Muffin as a proxy and setup Muffin to use the original
proxy.  (See the Muffin "Options..." window to configure Muffin to use
a proxy)

Check the Muffin "Options..." window to see if Muffin allows access to
your web browser.  "HostsAllow" and "HostsDeny" are comma separated
lists of IP addresses that are allowed and denied.  Partial IP address
can be specified and "ALL" matches all IP addresses.  An example
partial IP address would be 130.191.13. which is the same as all hosts
in the range 130.191.13.1 to 130.191.13.255.
