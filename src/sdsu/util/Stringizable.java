/**
 * An interface for objects that can convert itself to a string and "recreate" itself from 
 * that string. This interface is much more limited than Serializable. The few advantages 
 * Stringizable has over Serializable are: Stringizable works with Java 1.0.2, 
 * the string version of an object is readable and parsable by humans, and the 
 * string version of an object is ligher weight than in Serializable. The main use
 * of Stringizable is for use in Java 1.0.2, motivate for students
 * the utility of Serializable with less overhead, and for use in client-server
 * programing where the strings must satisfy a protocol.
